## Component Part
  1. Predict your digit handwritting
  2. Classification Model Simulator
  3. Dataset
  4. Evaluation
  5. Confusion matrix
  6. Model Performance (Accuracy score)

### 1. Predict your digit handwritting
The fisrt of all component, this one will predict your digit handwritting by upload picture(.png) into Drag and Drop or Select Files.
Then app will show your image and result on predicted value.

### 2. Classification Model Simulator
There are 3 options:
  1. Select Models    : Use for analyzes data patterns to determine future outcomes which provide 5 model are Neural Network, Random Forest, Logistic Regression,                         Extra Trees Classifier and XGB Classifier
  2. Test Set Size    : This will be split dataset to train and test size. Able to split test size minimun 0.1 and maximun 0.5
  3. Number of Splits : Setting number of K-fold (minimun 2 and maximun 5) for cross validation that is resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning                             models on a limited data sample.

### 3. Dataset
In this part show dataset information
  1. No. of Record      : Show total number of images in the dataset
  2. No. of Categories  : Show total number of categories. Maximun is 10 categories (๐ ๑ ๒ ๓ ๔ ๕ ๖ ๗ ๘ ๙)
  3. No. of Train set   : Show total number of images in train dataset
  4. No. of Test set    : Show total number of images in test dataset

### 4. Evaluation
In this part show evaluate results
  1. Best Model                       : Show the best model which is the highest train score. Model refer from user selecting model
  2. Accuracy score of the best model : Show score of best model that are train score, validation score and test score

### 5. Confusion matrix
The confusion matrix is generated by using the confusion matrix function from sklearn. The result is a 10 x 10 array that will be used to generate a heatmap in this GUI, where the 10 elements correspond to 10 Thai numerals.

Each row in the matrix represents the true label for each class, while each column represents the predicted label. The numbers shown in the matrix indicate the frequency of instances predicted as class j while the true label is class i. The diagonal of the matrix represents cases where the true and predicted labels are the same.

The heatmap is constructed using plotly and only the diagonal elements are annotated. The confusion matrix displayed depends on the best model.

### 6. Model Performance (Accuracy score)
Model Performance show about show train score, validation score and test score which refer from from user selecting model
more information about score :
1. Train score :  The training score is a metric that indicates how well a machine learning model performs on the training data it was trained on. It measures the degree to which the model has learned and adapted to the training dataset. A high training score suggests that the model has fit the training data well.
    
2. Validation score : The testing score, also known as the test accuracy or test score, is a metric used to evaluate how well a trained model performs on new, unseen data. It measures the model's ability to generalize and make accurate predictions on data it hasn't encountered during training. The testing score provides insights into how well the model is expected to perform in real-world scenarios.
    
3. Test score : The validation score is typically used during the model development process to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters. It is calculated by evaluating the model's performance on a separate validation dataset, which is different from both the training and testing datasets. The validation score helps in selecting the best model configuration by comparing the performance of different models or hyperparameter settings. It provides an estimate of how well the model is likely to perform on unseen data.
