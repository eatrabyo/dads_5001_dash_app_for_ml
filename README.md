## Component Part
  1. Predict your digit handwritting
  2. Classification Model Simulator
  3. Dataset
  4. Evaluation
  5. Confusion matrix
  6. Model Performance (Accuracy score)

### 1. Drag and drop new image for prediction
A drag and drop box is provided for uploading a picture. The picture will be predicted by the best model and the result will be shown under the picture.

### 2. Classification Model Simulator
There are 3 options:
  1. Select Models    : Use for analyze data patterns to determine future outcomes which provide 5 model are Neural Network, Random Forest, Logistic Regression,                         Extra Trees Classifier and XGB Classifier.
  2. Test Set Size    : This will split the dataset into training and testing sets. Users can specify the split size, with a minimum value of 0.1 and a maximum value of 0.5.
  3. Number of Splits : Set the number of K-fold cross-validation, which is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample. The number of folds can be set between a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 5.

### 4. Evaluation
In this part show evaluate results
  1. Best Model: Display the best model from the list of selected models, which has the highest training score.
  2. Accuracy score of the best model: Display the scores of the best model, including the training score, validation score, and test score.

### 5. Confusion matrix
The confusion matrix is generated by using the confusion matrix function from sklearn. The result is a 10 x 10 array that will be used to generate a heatmap in this GUI, where the 10 elements correspond to 10 Thai numerals.

Each row in the matrix represents the true label for each class, while each column represents the predicted label. The numbers shown in the matrix indicate the frequency of instances predicted as class j while the true label is class i. The diagonal of the matrix represents cases where the true and predicted labels are the same.

The heatmap is constructed using plotly and only the diagonal elements are annotated. The confusion matrix displayed depends on the best model.

### 6. Model Performance (Accuracy score)
The model performance shows the train score, validation score, and test score based on the user-selected model.

1. Train score :  The training score is a metric that indicates how well a machine learning model performs on the training data it was trained on. It measures the degree to which the model has learned and adapted to the training dataset. A high training score suggests that the model has fit the training data well.
    
2. Validation score : The testing score, also known as the test accuracy or test score, is a metric used to evaluate how well a trained model performs on new, unseen data. It measures the model's ability to generalize and make accurate predictions on data it hasn't encountered during training. The testing score provides insights into how well the model is expected to perform in real-world scenarios.
    
3. Test score : The validation score is typically used during the model development process to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters. It is calculated by evaluating the model's performance on a separate validation dataset, which is different from both the training and testing datasets. The validation score helps in selecting the best model configuration by comparing the performance of different models or hyperparameter settings. It provides an estimate of how well the model is likely to perform on unseen data.
