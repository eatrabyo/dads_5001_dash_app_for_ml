  5. Confusion matrix
  6. Model Performance (Accuracy score)

# 1. Predict your digit handwritting
The fisrt of all component, this one will predict your digit handwritting by upload picture(.png) into Drag and Drop or Select Files.
Then app will show your image and result on predicted value.

# 2. Classification Model Simulator
There are 3 options:
  1. Select Models    : Use for analyzes data patterns to determine future outcomes which provide 5 model are Neural Network, Random Forest, Logistic Regression,                         Extra Trees Classifier and XGB Classifier
  2. Test Set Size    : This will be split dataset to train and test size. Able to split test size minimun 0.1 and maximun 0.5
  3. Number of Splits : Setting number of K-fold (minimun 2 and maximun 5) for cross validation that is resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning                             models on a limited data sample.
